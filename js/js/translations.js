      aboutLead1: "Cargoworks is a Barcelona-based urban logistics company focused on making city deliveries more efficient, practical, and sustainable.",
      aboutLead2: "We specialize in cargo-bike delivery for businesses, with a strong focus on recurring operations. Our ideal partners are companies that deliver daily or several times a week and are either running van-based routes today or designing their delivery operation from scratch. In both cases, our role is the same: help build delivery systems that actually work in a dense city.",
      aboutSectionRecurringTitle: "Built for recurring delivery operations",
      aboutSectionRecurringBody1: "Cargo bikes are not a niche solution for us—they are the core of how we design urban logistics.",
      aboutSectionRecurringBody2: "For many city routes, especially those with short distances, multiple stops, and tight time windows, cargo bikes outperform vans in speed, reliability, and cost efficiency. Less time stuck in traffic, fewer access issues, and more predictable delivery times.",
      aboutSectionRecurringBody3: "That’s why most of our work is long-term and recurring. We work with businesses whose deliveries are a critical part of their day-to-day operations, not an occasional add-on.",
      aboutSectionMethodTitle: "From vans to bikes — with method",

      aboutSectionMethodOutro: "The goal isn’t ideology—it’s efficiency. Fewer delays, simpler operations, and logistics that fit the reality of the city.",
      aboutSectionSameDayTitle: "Same-day, when you need it",
      aboutSectionSameDayBody1: "Alongside recurring routes, we also offer same-day and on-demand deliveries. These are ideal for urgent documents, last-minute orders, replacements, or time-sensitive goods.",
      aboutSectionSameDayBody2: "Same-day jobs run on the same principles as our recurring work: clear pricing, realistic timing, and riders who know the city.",
      aboutSectionMoreThanTitle: "More than a courier service",
      aboutSectionMoreThanBody1: "Cargoworks is not just a pool of riders. Behind every delivery is an operations and pricing system built for clarity and consistency.",
      aboutSectionMoreThanBody2: "We avoid vague zones, opaque pricing, and improvised routing. Instead, we focus on structured quotes, logical routes, and decisions based on real urban conditions. This allows our clients to plan, scale, and trust their delivery operations.",
      aboutSectionRidersBody: "Our riders are experienced professionals who understand that care, communication, and reliability matter as much as speed.",
      aboutSectionWhyTitle: "Why we do it",

      aboutP1: "Cargoworks es un servicio de mensajería en cargo bike con base en Barcelona. Movemos cosas por la ciudad cada día, todo el año, en condiciones reales.",
      aboutP2: "En esencia, somos mensajeros. Lo que sostiene ese trabajo es experiencia sólida en logística con cargo bikes: rutas, tiempos, cargas, precios, operativa y personas. No solo montamos en bici — entendemos cómo funciona el reparto urbano y asumimos la responsabilidad de hacerlo bien.",
      aboutP3: "La logística con cargo bikes no es una tendencia para nosotros. Es una herramienta profesional.",
      aboutP4: "Trabajamos con empresas que reparten de forma regular y con clientes que necesitan envíos puntuales en el mismo día. Algunos están dejando atrás las furgonetas; otros empiezan directamente con bicicletas. En ambos casos, nuestro papel es hacer que los repartos sean simples, fiables y realistas.",
      aboutP5: "Cada servicio se planifica con cuidado. A veces implica rediseñar rutas. A veces ajustar expectativas. A menudo, simplemente simplificar.",
      aboutP6: "Asumimos responsabilidad hacia nuestros clientes, nuestros riders, la ciudad y el medio ambiente. La sostenibilidad no es un eslogan — es lo que ocurre cuando la logística está bien diseñada.",
